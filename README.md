StockFetch is a command-line application inspired by Neofetch, designed for stock market enthusiasts. It fetches and displays essential stock information alongside ASCII art logos of the requested ticker symbols in a visually appealing format. The output is color-coded to indicate whether the stock price has increased or decreased compared to its previous close.
